# Regex Recap

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for pattern matching within strings in JavaScript. While JavaScript provides methods like startsWith, endsWith, and includes for basic string searches, regex offers more comprehensive and dynamic search capabilities. In this tutorial, we'll explore the intricacies of regular expressions, focusing on various components and their functionalities.


## Summary

We'll be dissecting a specific regex pattern designed for basic username validation. The pattern  
{
	
	"Print to console": {
		"prefix": "log",
		"body": [
			"/^[a-z0-9_-]{3,16}$/"
		],
		"description": "code snippet"
	}
}
checks if a string fulfills the requirements for a basic username. This regex pattern ensures that the username contains lowercase letters, numbers, underscores, or hyphens and is between 3 and 16 characters long.
