# Validating Email Addresses with Regex

In modern web applications, validating user input is crucial to ensure data integrity and security. One common validation task is to verify the format of email addresses entered by users. In this project, we'll explore various regular expressions (regex) for validating email addresses and understand their components, strengths, and considerations. From simple validations to more robust patterns conforming to RFC standards, we'll delve into each regex variation step-by-step, providing insights into their design and usage.

## Summary

The regex we'll be discussing is a comprehensive pattern for validating email addresses, accommodating different levels of complexity and adherence to standards. Here's a summary of the regex pattern we'll explore:

```regex
^[A-Z0-9_!#$%&'*+/=?`{|}~^-]+(?:\.[A-Z0-9_!#$%&'*+/=?`{|}~^-]+)*@[A-Z0-9-]+(?:\.[A-Z0-9-]+)*$


We'll be dissecting a specific regex pattern designed for basic username validation. The pattern  
/^[a-z0-9_-]{3,16}$/
checks if a string fulfills the requirements for a basic username. This regex pattern ensures that the username contains lowercase letters, numbers, underscores, or hyphens and is between 3 and 16 characters long.
